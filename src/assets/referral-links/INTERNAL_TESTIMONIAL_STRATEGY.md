# SGCG Athlete Testimonial & Partnership Program
## Internal Strategy Document for Executive Team
**Prepared by:** Dennis Stratton  
**Date:** February 2025  
**Purpose:** Launch athlete testimonial program with referral tracking

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We have built and tested a referral tracking system that allows us to attribute new deal flow to specific athlete facilitators. This document outlines a tiered testimonial program that leverages this technology while providing multiple engagement levels for athletes based on their comfort and goals.

**Key Innovation:** Every athlete can have a unique referral link (e.g., `ncaa-settlement.com?ref=MarcusJohnsonOSU`) that tracks all form submissions back to them, enabling commission-based partnerships.

## MY CREDENTIALS (For Athlete Outreach)

"I'm Dennis Stratton, and beyond my role at SGCG, I co-created and produced 'Hotboxin' with Mike Tyson' and 'Real Ones with Jon Bernthal,' managing all their social content. I understand how to help athletes tell their stories authentically while building their personal brands. This isn't about corporate messaging - it's about sharing your genuine experience in a way that helps other athletes."

## RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Tier 1 Focus:** Launch with 5 commission-based facilitators who are natural promoters. This requires no upfront investment and proves the model. Once we see traction, expand to Tier 2 for broader social proof.

**Test Compensation Models:** Try different approaches with Tier 2:
- 2 athletes with cash payment
- 2 athletes with donation option
- 2 athletes with swag/perks
- Measure engagement and satisfaction

**Build for Scale:** Document everything, create templates, and build systems that can handle 100+ athlete partners by Q2.
