## Athlete Outreach Message Template

### Initial Contact (Tier 1 Focus)

**Subject: Content Partnership Opportunity - Your SGCG Success Story**

Hi [Athlete Name],

Congratulations again on successfully completing your NIL settlement claim sale with SGCG! 

We'd love to feature your success story and offer you an opportunity to earn facilitator commissions by helping other athletes in your network access their settlements quickly.

**Quick Background:** I'm Dennis Stratton, and beyond leading partnerships at SGCG, I have extensive experience creating content with elite athletes. I co-created and produced "Hotboxin' with Mike Tyson" and "Real Ones with Jon Bernthal," managing all their social content and helping them connect authentically with their audiences.

**The Opportunity:**
We're launching a testimonial program with multiple participation options. The premium tier includes:
- Personal referral link with commission tracking
- Co-published content on our platforms
- My direct support in creating testimonial content that fits your personal brand
- Complete control over tone and messaging

**Your Options:**
1. **Video testimonial** (30-60 seconds) with referral program - highest earning potential
2. **Written testimonial** for social/website use
3. **Website-only** quote
4. **Anonymous** or private use only

I'll personally work with you to ensure any content feels authentic to your voice and resonates with your followers. This isn't about corporate messaging - it's about sharing your genuine experience in a way that helps other athletes while building your facilitator network.

**Next Steps:**
Reply with your preferred tier, and I'll send you:
- Your personal referral link
- Content guidelines tailored to your preference
- Direct support for content creation

Looking forward to partnering with you!

Best,
Dennis Stratton

**Metrics to Track:**
