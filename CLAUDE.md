- Additional Information (optional textarea)

## ✅ FIXED: Netlify Forms Issue Resolved (2025-01-18)

### Final Working Solution
**Root Cause**: Form was submitting to wrong endpoint with action attribute
**Solution**: 
- Removed action attribute from hidden HTML form
- Changed JavaScript submission to POST to "/" instead of "/contact.html"
- Kept proper URL encoding with URLSearchParams

### Changes Made:
1. **Created `/public/success.html`**
   - Success confirmation page with auto-redirect after 3 seconds
   - Shows "Thank you" message to users
   - Redirects back to main site automatically

2. **Modified React Form in HeroVictoryLane.tsx**
   - Removed JavaScript `onSubmit` handler and `preventDefault()`
   - Added `action="/success.html"` for direct POST submission
   - Added `data-netlify="true"` attribute
   - Removed state management for form submission
   - Kept all form fields and HTML5 validation

3. **Updated `/public/contact.html`**
   - Ensured exact field name matching with React form
   - Added proper action="/success.html" attribute
   - Included all Netlify attributes and honeypot field
   - Added required attributes to match React form

### How It Works Now:
- Form submits directly via standard HTML POST (no JavaScript interception)
- Netlify intercepts the form submission at the edge
- Form data is captured in Netlify Forms dashboard
- Email notifications are sent to configured addresses
- User sees success page and is auto-redirected back

### Key Learning:
The breakthrough came from reading Netlify's documentation which revealed:
1. Forms must submit to "/" or current page (not custom endpoints)
2. Action attributes can interfere with Netlify's form detection
3. Proper research of documentation is critical before attempting fixes
4. The working test form succeeded because it had no action attribute

## ✅ COMPLETED: Site Successfully Launched!

### 2. **Domain Migration Steps**

#### Remove Squarespace Redirects:
1. Log into Squarespace dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Domains
3. Find ncaa-settlement.com redirect
4. Find nil-settlement.com redirect  
5. Remove/disable both redirects
6. Note down current DNS settings

#### Connect Domains to Netlify:
1. In Netlify: Domain settings → Add custom domain
2. Add `ncaa-settlement.com`
3. Add `nil-settlement.com`
4. Follow Netlify's DNS instructions
5. Update nameservers at domain registrar
6. SSL certificates auto-provision (takes ~10-30 min)

### 3. **Final Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Test contact form with real email service
- [ ] Verify emails arrive to all 3 recipients
- [ ] Check both domains resolve correctly
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates are active
- [ ] Test all links and navigation
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Run Google PageSpeed test

### 4. **Environment Variables for Netlify**
Add these in Netlify dashboard:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (or chosen email service key)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (update to live domain)

### 5. **Monitor After Launch**
- Check Netlify analytics
- Monitor form submissions
- Watch for any 404 errors
- Check site uptime

### Key Files Reference:
- **Main Component**: `/components/HeroVictoryLane.tsx`
- **Form Detection**: `/public/contact.html` (hidden form for Netlify)
- **Links Config**: `/config/links-config.json`
- **SEO Files**: `/public/sitemap.xml`, `/public/robots.txt`
- **OG Image**: `/public/og-image.png`

### Remaining Tasks:
- ✅ **Generate OG Image**: DONE - Using PNG logo (though could optimize to 1200x630 dimensions)
- **Optimize Images**: Use TinyPNG to compress logo files (currently 29KB, target <15KB)
- ✅ **Test Social Sharing**: DONE - Facebook showing image correctly
- ✅ **Submit Sitemap**: DONE - Successfully submitted to Google Search Console
- **Set Up Analytics**: Google Analytics or similar for tracking conversions
- **Monitor Form Submissions**: Check Netlify Forms dashboard for leads
- Phone number for contact link (optional)
- Direct email for contact link (optional)

### Current File Structure for Forms:
```
/components/HeroVictoryLane.tsx - Main React component with form
  - Uses JavaScript fetch to submit to /contact.html
  - Shows success/error messages
  - Form has name="contact" 
  
/public/contact.html - Netlify detection form
  - Visible form with data-netlify="true"
  - Has all the same fields as React form
  - Never seen by users
```
