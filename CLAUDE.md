**Domain Setup for nilsettlement.com & ncaasettlement.com:**
1. **Remove Squarespace Redirects:**
   - Log into Squarespace account for sycamoregroveclaims.com
   - Navigate to Settings → Domains
   - Locate nilsettlement.com and ncaasettlement.com redirects
   - Remove/disable these redirects
   - Note down current DNS settings

2. **Configure New DNS:**
   - Update A records to point to new hosting IP
   - Configure CNAME records if using CDN
   - Set up proper MX records for email
   - Allow 24-48 hours for propagation

3. **Verify Setup:**

## Current Design:
**Primary Theme: Athletic (Black background with teal accents) - ONLY THEME**

- Large "HOUSE VS NCAA" title with teal "VS"
- "SELL YOUR CLAIM" with hover effect (teal background 10% opacity)
- Footer bar: "Sycamore Grove Claims Group" (white) • "Learn More" (teal)
- Two-column layout: company info left, contact form right
- Glass morphism cards with athletic texture backgrounds
- All colors use Sycamore Grove teal (#439aa3)
- Theme toggle removed - site now only displays athletic theme

## Lessons Learned:
- Focus on fundamentals before attempting complex features
- Simple, well-executed design > complex failures
- Athletic imagery crucial for connecting with target audience
- User feedback should be taken literally, not interpreted

## Form Field Changes Summary
**Contact Form Now Collects:**
- Full Name (required)
- Email Address (required)
- Phone Number (optional)
- Sport (optional dropdown)
- School (required text field)
- Start Year (required text field, 2016-2023)
- End Year (required text field, 2016-2023)
- Additional Information (optional textarea)

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Netlify Forms Not Working

### Current Status (2025-01-18)
**Problem**: Contact form submissions are not being captured by Netlify
- Form shows "success" message to users
- But NO submissions appear in Netlify Forms dashboard  
- NO email notifications sent to configured addresses
- Issue has persisted through 15+ attempted solutions over 2+ hours

### What WORKS:
- Simple HTML test form at `/test-form.html` worked perfectly
- Test form had basic HTML with `data-netlify="true"` 
- Submissions appeared in dashboard and emails were sent

### What DOESN'T WORK:
- Main contact form in React component (`/components/HeroVictoryLane.tsx`)
- Current implementation uses JavaScript to submit to `/public/contact.html`
- `/public/contact.html` has a visible form for Netlify detection

### Failed Attempts:
1. JavaScript submission to "/" endpoint
2. JavaScript submission to "/contact.html" endpoint
3. Native HTML form submission (no preventDefault)
4. Hidden detection form in public/contact.html
5. Visible form in public/contact.html
6. Form in layout.tsx (caused Next.js plugin build errors)
7. Static form in app directory
8. Various data-netlify attribute combinations
9. Removing/adding bot-field honeypot
10. Using different form names
11. URLSearchParams vs JSON body

### Technical Details:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Netlify deployment with @netlify/plugin-nextjs v5.11.6
- Form detection shows "contact" form exists in Netlify
- Email notifications configured for 3 addresses
- No console errors when submitting
- Network shows 200 OK response but form data not captured

### Key Mystery:
Why does a simple HTML test form work perfectly, but the same approach fails for the main form in the React component?

## 🚀 GO-LIVE CHECKLIST (After Form Issue Resolved)

### 2. **Domain Migration Steps**

#### Remove Squarespace Redirects:
1. Log into Squarespace dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Domains
3. Find ncaa-settlement.com redirect
4. Find nil-settlement.com redirect  
5. Remove/disable both redirects
6. Note down current DNS settings

#### Connect Domains to Netlify:
1. In Netlify: Domain settings → Add custom domain
2. Add `ncaa-settlement.com`
3. Add `nil-settlement.com`
4. Follow Netlify's DNS instructions
5. Update nameservers at domain registrar
6. SSL certificates auto-provision (takes ~10-30 min)

### 3. **Final Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Test contact form with real email service
- [ ] Verify emails arrive to all 3 recipients
- [ ] Check both domains resolve correctly
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates are active
- [ ] Test all links and navigation
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Run Google PageSpeed test

### 4. **Environment Variables for Netlify**
Add these in Netlify dashboard:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (or chosen email service key)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (update to live domain)

### 5. **Monitor After Launch**
- Check Netlify analytics
- Monitor form submissions
- Watch for any 404 errors
- Check site uptime

### Key Files Reference:
- **Main Component**: `/components/HeroVictoryLane.tsx`
- **Email Handler**: `/app/api/contact/route.ts` (needs email service code)
- **Links Config**: `/config/links-config.json`

### Still Needed:
- **CRITICAL**: Fix Netlify Forms submission issue
- Phone number for contact link (optional)
- Direct email for contact link (optional)

### Current File Structure for Forms:
```
/components/HeroVictoryLane.tsx - Main React component with form
  - Uses JavaScript fetch to submit to /contact.html
  - Shows success/error messages
  - Form has name="contact" 
  
/public/contact.html - Netlify detection form
  - Visible form with data-netlify="true"
  - Has all the same fields as React form
  - Never seen by users
```
