# ðŸŽ¨ Checkpoint 1: Hero Section Design

## Design Decisions Made:

### Layout & Typography
- **Main Headline**: "HOUSE VS NCAA" in dark teal, "NIL SETTLEMENT" in brand teal
- **Font Size**: 48px mobile / 120px desktop (Bebas Neue)
- **Subheadline**: Clean, professional Inter font emphasizing "now"
- **Value Props**: Using Teko font for numbers ($150,000 average claim)

### Color Usage
- **Background**: White with very subtle teal gradient (3-5% opacity)
- **Text Hierarchy**:
  - Primary: Dark teal (#0a423b) for main headline
  - Accent: Brand teal (#439aa3) for emphasis
  - Supporting: Gray tones for body text
  - Alert: Victory red for urgency ("Get Paid in Days")

### CTAs
- **Primary CTA**: "Sell Your Claim" - Teal background, white text
- **Secondary CTA**: "Learn More" - Red outline, red text
- Both buttons are large (56px height) for mobile-friendly tapping

### Professional Elements
- Clean, minimal design avoiding "busy" athletic patterns
- Subtle gradient instead of bold backgrounds
- Trust indicator at bottom: "$380M+ Paid to Claimants"
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion

### Key Features
1. **Mobile-First**: Responsive text sizing and button layout
2. **Fast Loading**: Minimal assets, optimized SVG patterns
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Immediate understanding of purpose
4. **Trust Building**: Company credibility subtly included

## Questions for You:

1. **Background**: Should we keep it minimal or add more athletic energy?
2. **CTAs**: Are "Sell Your Claim" and "Learn More" the right messages?
3. **Value Props**: Is "$150,000 average" and "Days not Decades" effective?
4. **Overall Feel**: Does this strike the right balance of professional + athletic?

## Next Steps:
Once approved, I'll add the navigation header with logo and social media icons.
