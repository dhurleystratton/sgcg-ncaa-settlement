## üö® Conversion Rate Emergency Plan

### Problem: 40 Clicks, 0 Conversions = 0% Conversion Rate

3. Form intimidation? ‚Üí Consider A/B testing a lighter initial form
4. Expectation mismatch ‚Üí Ensure ad copy matches landing page messaging

### Recommended A/B Tests:

**Test 1: Form Length**
- Variant A (Current): Full 8-field form
- Variant B: 3-field form (Name, Email, Phone) ‚Üí "We'll contact you"

**Test 2: CTA Placement**

- Variant B: Add hero CTA button that opens modal form

**Test 3: Social Proof**
