# Design Principles - NCAA Settlement Landing Page

## Core Values
1. **Athletic Excellence**: Every design decision should evoke sports, competition, and achievement
2. **Youth-Focused**: Appeal to 22-30 year old former athletes, not 50+ finance executives
3. **Trust Through Design**: Build credibility through quality, not corporate clichés
4. **Speed & Performance**: Both visual and technical - fast, dynamic, responsive
5. **Clear Purpose**: Value proposition understood in 3 seconds

## Target Audience Profile
- **Age**: 22-30 (Gen Z and younger Millennials)
- **Background**: Former D1 athletes (2016-2024)
- **Tech Savvy**: Mobile-first, social media natives

- **Pain Points**: Need money now, complex settlement process, distrust of finance companies

## Tone & Messaging
- **Voice**: Confident, direct, peer-to-peer

5. **Engagement**: Users explore calculator

## Decision Framework
When in doubt, ask:
1. Would a 25-year-old former athlete find this engaging?
2. Does it look like every other financial site? (If yes, change it)
3. Is it fast, clear, and actionable?
4. Does it build trust through quality, not convention?
